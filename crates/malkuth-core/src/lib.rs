//! # malkuth-core
//!
//! The **contract layer** of malkuth: wire/protocol types and trait
//! definitions that are independent of any async runtime (tokio / async-std /
//! smol) and any server framework (axum / hyper / …).
//!
//! Everything here is deliberately free of:
//! - a specific async runtime (only [`futures_io`] / [`event_listener`] are
//!   used, which work under *any* executor), and
//! - a specific wire framework (HTTP, axum, etc. are implementation choices
//!   made one layer up in the `malkuth` crate).
//!
//! Concrete runtime/framework implementations live in the `malkuth` crate;
//! this crate is what they all agree on.
