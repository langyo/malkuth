//! # malkuth
//!
//! Runtime-agnostic service-supervision toolkit: JSON-RPC over pluggable
//! transports (TCP / WebSocket / IPC), supervised workers, split health probes
//! and coordination locks. Built on [`malkuth_core`] and the `futures_io`
//! async-I/O family, so it runs under tokio, async-std or smol.
